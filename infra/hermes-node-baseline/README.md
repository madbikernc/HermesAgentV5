# hermes-node-baseline — S17 recreate checklist

**Version:** 1.0.0

Daily local-node security baseline (aide file-integrity, lynis hardening audit, syft+grype
SBOM/CVE), diffed day-over-day, with new medium+ findings written as durable, queryable
recommendations and routed — once the operator explicitly authorizes one over Matrix — to
either `hermes-remediate-worker` (an allowlisted mechanical action) or `hermes-dualcoder` (the
coder/coder2 adversarial review loop). Full design/rationale is in the S17 plan this was built
from; see `tools/hermes-node-baseline-scan.py` and `tools/hermes-baseline-authorize-watch.py`
for the header comments carrying the actual reasoning — not duplicated here.

## Components

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tools/hermes-node-baseline-scan.py` | The scanner: runs aide/lynis/syft+grype, normalizes findings, diffs against yesterday, writes a hermes-memory recommendation (`REC-<node>-<date>-<seq>`) per new medium+ finding, auto-resolves findings that disappear, sends one Matrix+email digest per run. |
| `tools/hermes-node-baseline-scan-wrapper.sh` | Fetches Vaultwarden secrets (memory-token, matrix-fleetops, email) and execs the scanner. One instance per node, parameterized by node name. |
| `tools/hermes-baseline-authorize-watch.py` | Long-running watcher: polls FleetOps for `authorize REC-...` / `reject REC-...` from the real Boss Matrix account, then routes an authorized recommendation. |
| `tools/hermes-baseline-authorize-watch-wrapper.sh` | Fetches this watcher's secrets (memory-token, buzz-token, matrix-fleetops, broker-token) and execs it. Single instance, any one node. |
| `config/*.json.template` | Copy the one matching your node to `$HERMES_HOME/config/node-baseline.json` and fill in real paths — **not committed to git with real values**, same convention as `node-health.json`. |
| `hermes-node-baseline-scan@.service` / `@.timer` | Templated per-node unit (`%i` = node name). |
| `hermes-baseline-authorize-watch.service` | Single-instance unit. |

## Recommendation lifecycle

`pending` (written by the scanner) → operator replies in FleetOps →
`rejected` | `routed-remediate` | `routed-dualcoder` | `manual-required` → (for a resolved
underlying finding, any state) → `resolved` (written automatically by the next day's scan when
the finding disappears).

Full history for any `REC-...` id: `GET {MEMORY_URL}/turns?task_id=REC-...` — same query
`hermes-dualcoder.py` already relies on for its own transcript, no new endpoint needed.

## Required manual setup per node (not automated — a privilege change, done deliberately)

`aide --check` and `lynis audit system` need root. Add exactly these two read-only audit
commands to `pmoney`'s sudoers, narrowly scoped — same precedent as the existing `sudo nmap`
entry `tools/hermes-security-scan.py` already depends on:

```
# /etc/sudoers.d/hermes-node-baseline
pmoney ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/aide --check --config /etc/aide/aide.conf
pmoney ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/lynis audit system --quiet --no-colors
```

Also required, once, before the first scan on a node: `sudo aide --init && sudo cp
/var/lib/aide/aide.db.new.gz /var/lib/aide/aide.db.gz` to establish the initial file-integrity
baseline. Re-run `aide --init` (with the operator's sign-off) whenever a legitimate bulk change
makes the old baseline noisy — this is a manual step, not something the scanner does for you.

## Install

```bash
sudo cp hermes-node-baseline-scan@.service hermes-node-baseline-scan@.timer /etc/systemd/system/
sudo cp hermes-baseline-authorize-watch.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now hermes-node-baseline-scan@spark.timer     # on spark
sudo systemctl enable --now hermes-node-baseline-scan@spark-2.timer   # on spark-2
sudo systemctl enable --now hermes-node-baseline-scan@homed13.timer   # on HomeD13
sudo systemctl enable --now hermes-baseline-authorize-watch.service   # on ONE node only
```

## Verify

```bash
# Dry run, no persist/notify:
python3 tools/hermes-node-baseline-scan.py --dry-run

# Real run once sudoers + aide --init are in place:
sudo systemctl start hermes-node-baseline-scan@$(hostname).service
journalctl -u hermes-node-baseline-scan@$(hostname).service -n 50

# Confirm a synthetic finding round-trips: touch a file aide tracks, re-run, confirm a REC
# shows up in the FleetOps digest, then:
curl -s $MEMORY_URL/turns?task_id=<REC-id> -H "Authorization: Bearer $MEMORY_TOKEN"

# Reply "authorize <REC-id>" in FleetOps from the real Boss account, confirm
# hermes-baseline-authorize-watch routes it and a second identical reply is a no-op.
```

## Known gaps, stated plainly rather than assumed away

- Exact aide report format / lynis `report.dat` field layout / syft CLI source-string syntax
  were verified against each tool's documented shape and against realistic sample output in
  unit tests, but never against a real installed binary on a live node — do that first, per the
  S17 plan's own build order.
- `service-restart` routing only fires when a finding's `suggested_remediation` explicitly
  names both a `target` unit and a `sintra`/`amy` `identity` — no scan tool emits that today, so
  this path is inert until a future finding type populates it. Everything else routes to
  `manual-required` or `dualcoder`.
- Routing to `dualcoder` gets you a reviewed **script**, not an applied fix — dualcoder never
  executes anything (same posture as `hermes-code-security-scan.py`). A human still runs the
  result. Don't oversell this as unattended auto-remediation; it isn't.

## Revision History
